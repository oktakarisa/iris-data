Iris Dataset Background
-----------------------
- The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in statistics and machine learning.
- It was introduced in 1936 by Ronald A. Fisher, a British statistician.
- The dataset was originally used in his paper:
    "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems".
- Fisher collected data about three species of Iris flowers:
    * Iris setosa
    * Iris versicolor
    * Iris virginica
- Each flower sample has 4 measurements (features):
    1. Sepal length
    2. Sepal width
    3. Petal length
    4. Petal width
- There are 150 samples total (50 per species).
- The dataset was originally collected from the Gaspé Peninsula in Canada.
- Why it matters:
    * It’s small and clean — easy to practice on.
    * It’s historically important — used in early examples of discriminant analysis.
    * It’s widely available in scikit-learn and other libraries.
